# Data Structures Projects 📚

Programming assignments developed for the course  **"Data Structures"** 

Each assignment explores core data structures and algorithms through practical implementations in Java.

## 📁 Contents

### 🔹 Assignment 1 – Stack & Queue Implementations and Maze Solving
- Custom implementations of **stack** and **queue** using linked nodes.
- Simulated a **maze solver** using **stack-based DFS** (Depth-First Search).
- Input: Maze from a `.txt` file  
- Output: Whether the exit is found or not.

➡ *Topics:* ADTs, recursion, file I/O, stack/queue logic

---

### 🔹 Assignment 2 – Sorting & Priority Queues
- Modified a **Max Priority Queue** using generics.
- Implemented two algorithms for distributing folders into disks:
  - **Greedy algorithm**
  - **Sort + Greedy**
- Ran performance tests with multiple `.txt` files of random input sizes (100, 500, 1000).
- Compared disk usage efficiency across both strategies.

➡ *Topics:* Heaps, priority queues, merge sort, algorithmic complexity, benchmarking

### 🔹 Assignment 3 – Range Search & Nearest Neighbor on 2D Trees
- Implemented 2D spatial structures with:
  - `contains(Point p)`
  - `intersects(Rectangle r)`
  - `rangeSearch(Rectangle r)`
  - `nearestNeighbor(Point p)`
- Recursive traversal of 2D trees for geometric queries.
- Efficient spatial data lookup.

➡ *Topics:* 2D trees (k-d trees), computational geometry, recursion
